      <p><em>&quot;To know the future, you must understand the past.&quot;</em></p>
      <p>Over the past decade, recognizing historical value in how communities have been represented has been essential
         to moving forward and changing our day-to-day lives for the better. By getting a stronger idea of how our
         cities and neighborhoods <em>used</em> to be structured, we can have a fuller perspective on the places we live
         in, and take pride in building the future we want to see in future generations! For this, we have a solution
         close to home: <strong>MinneHistory</strong>.</p>
      <p>MinneHistory takes a modern-day GIS display and shows a stitched collection of <em>30</em> different maps from
         the 50s! With the map overlay, you can see images of <strong>prime</strong> areas where there have been
         <em>huge</em> transitions in urban planning and demographics of the different areas of Minneapolis.
      </p>
      <h3 id="with-minnehistory-you-can-explore-what-life-was-and-imagine-what-life-could-be-">With MinneHistory, you
         can explore what life <em>was</em>, and imagine what life could <em>be</em>.</h3>
      <h1 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation</h1>
      <p>Our project is composed of a golang backend with pure javascript and css on the frontend. To build the historic
         aerial shot of Minneapolis we had to compose and edit over 30 aerial shots from the 50s to get them to align
         properly and match the current streets to stitch a large aerial shot of Minneapolis. We felt that building this
         historic aerial shot was important to show the most important change that has occured to the streets of
         Minneapolis and it&#39;s urban form, the construction of I-94 and I-35W. These projects along with auto-centric
         infastructure led to a drastic change to the historic downtown and surrounding communites of Minneapolis. Our
         map is drawn by the open-source Javascript library Leaflet and all the data collection for different spots that
         have changed throughout Minneapollis was done by hand.</p>
